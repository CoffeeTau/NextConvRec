# NextConvRec
Official PyTorch implementation of NextConvRec, a purely convolutional framework for session-based recommendation. It integrates a Structural and Positional Convolutional Encoder (SPCE) with modern convolutional blocks to model multi-type dependencies efficiently without attention mechanisms.
